### Hi there, I am HenryðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on things related to Discord.js

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Java and JavaScript (Kotlin and TypeScript Soonâ„¢)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m apart of Vade Development, and mainly foucsing on the music side of things for [Vade](https://vade-bot.com) bot. Occasionally, you could find me commenting on the [EvoBot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot) repo

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! Whether is MongoDB or any other JavaScript and Discord.js related questions I will be more than happy to help with!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can add me on Discord `Hackel#1337`

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

- âš¡ Fun fact: As a poor college student, I first started working on Discord.js because I didn't want to pay for premium commands


_Also I totally didn't just use the template they had_
